# platform support #

This code has been tested with Microsoft .NET 3.5 on Windows 2008 Server/IIS7, Windows 2003 Server/IIS6, and Windows XP/IIS6; and with Mono 2.6.1 on MacOS X 10.6.1.

Mono 2.4.2.3 is inadequate to pass the full test suite, so use a later release or see [mono bugzilla](https://bugzilla.novell.com/buglist.cgi?bug_id=537751,553022,553063) for details.

# Do you know about [MvcContrib](http://www.codeplex.com/MVCContrib)? #

Yes, I've heard of it, but they are really slow and non-communicative about proposed contributions (!) so I thought I'd just publish this myself.

# Does it work with [Spark](http://dev.dejardin.org/)? #

Yes, it works with Spark as well as with the Web Forms view engine. I haven't tried it with other view engines, but I'm pretty sure it would work with those too.

# Is there an announce mailing list for release notifications? #

No, but perhaps you would like to subscribe to [the atom feed for downloads](http://code.google.com/feeds/p/mvcutils/downloads/basic).
